 * Encounter Service facility is typically the location a medical service was rendered, such as a provider office or hospital.
 * For telehealth, service facility can represent the provider's location when the service was delivered (e.g., home),
 * or the location where an in-person visit would have taken place, whichever is easier to identify.
 * If the provider is in-network, service facility may be defined in payer contracts.
 * Box 32 on the CMS-1500 claim form.
 * Note that for an in-network claim to be successfully adjudicated, the service facility address listed on claims
 * must match what was provided to the payer during the credentialing process.
