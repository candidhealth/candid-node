 * The billing provider is the provider or business entity submitting the claim.
 * Billing provider may be, but is not necessarily, the same person/NPI as the rendering provider.
 * From a payer's perspective, this represents the person or entity being reimbursed.
 * When a contract exists with the target payer, the billing provider should be the entity contracted with the payer.
 * In some circumstances, this will be an individual provider. In that case, submit that provider's NPI and the
 * tax ID (TIN) that the provider gave to the payer during contracting.
 * In other cases, the billing entity will be a medical group. If so, submit the group NPI and the group's tax ID.
 * Box 33 on the CMS-1500 claim form.
