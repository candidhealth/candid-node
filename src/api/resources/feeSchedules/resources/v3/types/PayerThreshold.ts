/**
 * Rate thresholds that determine fee schedule rate matching behavior. When a service line is adjudicated by a payer Candid determines if the payer's allowed amount "matches" the rate value. If the allowed amount doesn't equal the rate value, Candid moves the claim to a PAID_INCORRECTLY state. These optional thresholds allow a user to set wiggle room to avoid claims moving to PAID_INCORRECTLY and instead have them move directly to FINALIZED_PAID when the payer's allowed amount is greater than [rate_cents - lower_threshold_cents] and less than [rate_cents + upper_threshold_cents].\n Additionally, a client can set disable_paid_incorrectly to avoid the PAID_INCORRECTLY claim status entirely.
