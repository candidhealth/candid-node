/**
 * A type of bill can either be seen as a compositio of structured parts, or as a literal string.
 * This union represents the potential to express a type of bill either as one of those two shapes.
 * Passing a string, this update will be seen as a complete 4 digit code, along with a padding code 0, that
 * should match a valid composition.
 * Passing as a structure, the update will be seen as three parts and will be joined together by the server
 * to represent a valid composition for you.
 * Which you use depends upon whether you are "passing through" coded information or making a decision about its
 * structure explicitly.
